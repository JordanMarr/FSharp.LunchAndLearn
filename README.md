# FSharp.LunchAndLearn
Code samples from a presentation

## Content:
* Active Patterns (bonus content!)
* Option type: Fundamentals + examples
* Result type: Fundamentals + examples
* Final Project: Uses Option type, Result type + FsToolkit.ErrorHandling lib to implement a prod-ready feature

These samples, while contrived, are meant to simulate "real-life" problems as much as possible (async, error handling, etc).

Most samples can be run using F# Interactive (highlight the relevant code and hit Alt+Enter).
